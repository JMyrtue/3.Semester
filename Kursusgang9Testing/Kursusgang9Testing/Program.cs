//Exceptions is a feature in programmering languages, where you indicate an unintende behavior of the program. The terminology, is that you throw
//an exception, and catch it, in order to handle said behavior. Exceptions are used to avoid crashing your program when something unintended happens. Finally, 
//exceptions are a key koncept of testing - atleast with the xUnit framework.

//Code coverage is principle of deciding how much of your program is covered by test cases. There are no standard as to what percentage of code coverage is needed 
//for a program of quality, and achieving 100% code coverage can be expensive in man hours.

//TDD is the concept of creating a test case for the functionality you want to develop, before you develop said funcitonality. If used correctly, you will end up 
//creating more and more testcases as the development progresses. The benefits of the strategy, is that your program will be simpler, more efficient and more readable, 
//than if test cases was written after development.
